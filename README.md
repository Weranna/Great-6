Great6 - Pixel-Game

Description:
Welcome to Great 6, a simple yet engaging 2D pixel game created in Python using the Pygame library. In this game, you embark on a journey where you can explore a vibrant pixelated world, battle enemies, and witness the beginning of a thrilling adventure (wink).
Currently, the focus is on basic functionalities, allowing players to move around and engage in simple battles with enemies.

Features:

Basic Movement: Navigate through the pixelated landscape with ease, exploring the surroundings.
Combat System: Engage in simple but exciting battles with enemies scattered across the map. Hone your combat skills and defeat foes to progress further.
Single Playable Character: Start your adventure with the default character, each with a unique look and a simple background story. In the future, there are plans to introduce a choice of six characters, each with distinct appearances and narratives.
Future Improvements: Look forward to upcoming updates that will introduce NPCs, quests, and a more immersive gaming experience. The game's world will expand with the addition of different biomes, providing diverse environments to explore.
Image Usage: Currently, the game uses images downloaded from the internet. In future releases, there are plans to incorporate original images, adding a personalized touch to the gaming experience.
Dependency: The only dependency for this project is Pygame, a popular library for creating games in Python. Make sure to install it before running the game.

Future Roadmap:
NPCs and Quests: Interact with non-playable characters, take on quests, and immerse yourself in a more intricate storyline.
Expanded Map: Explore diverse biomes, each with its unique challenges and rewards.
Character Selection: Choose from a roster of six characters, each with its appearance and background story, allowing for a more personalized gaming experience.
